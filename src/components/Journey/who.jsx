                  She is a woman who became a voice for the voiceless, strength for the struggling, and a shining hope for the unheard. Her name is Ms. Prachi Kaushik, a changemaker, a trailblazer, and above all, a fierce believer in the power of women. She has educated over 2.5 million women about menstrual hygiene, breaking taboos and replacing shame with dignity. Her work in sanitation has brought real change to the way women live, lead, and care for themselves.

                  Moreover, she has turned over 10,000 women into entrepreneurs, guiding them from grassroots levels to financial independence. These women now own small businesses, work in manufacturing, and support their families with pride and purpose. Under her medical camps, more than 5,000 women have received proper medical treatment. She launched training programs in slum areas to reduce crime, improve sanitation and hygiene, and create real employment opportunities.

                  As a single woman, she fought all odds with her skills and education and also taught other girls to realize the power within and feel enlightened. A woman who chose the path of self-awakening to survive and embraced a dignified life, she continues contributing to the vision of Viksit Bharat through grassroots development and the use of modern technologies.
