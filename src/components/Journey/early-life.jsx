                    Ms Prachi Kaushik was born on December 05, 1984 in Delhi, close to the Delhi-Haryana border. Being a daughter of a daily wage labourer and a housewife, she grew up in a challenging environment and saw poverty and lack of amenities at every step of her way. Well this challenge came because of her family condition; however, she faced several other stumbling blocks because she grew up in a community where educating girls was not just rare but actively discouraged. However, she had been a rebellion since her childhood and always stood against the wrongdoings of society.

                    She completed her primary and secondary education in a government school. After her 12th standard, there was strong pressure from family and relatives to end her education and settle into an early marriage. No one expected or encouraged her to continue studying. In fact, no woman in her family had pursued higher education before. But, she had other plans. She resisted every expectation and objection, firmly said no to early marriage and yes to her own future.
                    With no financial support, she started taking tuition classes to fund her college education. She graduated with a degree in Political Science from Rajdhani College, Delhi, and later pursued her Master’s through the Faculty of Open Learning at Delhi University.

                    For a long time, her goal was simply to exist on her own terms in a world that didn’t seem to want her to. As the eldest sibling, the burden of supporting her family also fell on her shoulders. After college, though she dreamed of pursuing UPSC or even a PhD, financial responsibilities pulled her into the workforce. She took up jobs to support her younger siblings’ education while continuing her own studies whenever possible.
